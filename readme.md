## Dataset
Do you think childbirth is risky now?  In the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital, as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. Dr. Semmelweis started to study data from 2 clinics in this hospital and he made profound findings. I reanalyzed this data from the hospital, it contains 4 variables and 12 values. 
### Variables
* Year
* Births
* Deaths
* Clinic
<br> I visualized this data using plots and determined the effects of handwashing on the high level of deaths in Vienna General Hospital.

# Summary of findings 
Handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points.
